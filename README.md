# PHP DateTime Calculation Error

This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP's DateTime handling and provides a solution.

The issue lies in the incorrect use of `DateTime` and `DateInterval` for adding a month, which can lead to unexpected date calculations, particularly around month-end.

The `bug.php` file showcases the erroneous code, and `bugSolution.php` offers a corrected approach.
